    "If $f(x)$ is reducible, that means we can find $a(x), b(x)$, such that $f(x) = a(x)*b(x)$. Degree of $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ should be smaller than $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since mathematicians have not discovered the necessary condition of wherther a function is irreducible, and some famous criterions, such as Eisenstein's irreducibility criterion, are just sufficient conditions, we have to use exhaustive search.\n",
    "\n",
    " If we list all the possibilities of $a(x)$. Check whether $a(x)$ can be divisible by $f(x)$, we will know whether $f(x)$ is irreducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $a(x)$, we only need to condider degree equal and smaller than $fld(\\frac{degree\\, of\\, f(x)}{2})$. For example, if we have $f(x)$ with degree 9. We consider 4 as the maximum degree of $a(x)$ (Round down).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a polynomial whose deg is n and modulo p, there are $p^n$ possible situations. We express all possibilities in decimal, and then convert them to p carry numbers, which corresponds to an array of polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for $a(x)$ with maximum degree 1 and mod 3, we have following $3^2$ posibilities (On the right is the highest order coefficient):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$[0\\ 0]=0 \\quad  [1\\ 0]=1 \\quad  [2\\ 0]=2$$\n",
    "$$[0\\ 1]=3 \\quad  [1\\ 1]=4 \\quad  [2\\ 1]=5$$\n",
    "$$[0\\ 2]=6 \\quad  [1\\ 2]=7 \\quad  [2\\ 2]=8$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then do the polynomual divide, judge whether the remainder is 0. If the remainder equal to 0, that means the polynomial is irreducible.\n"
